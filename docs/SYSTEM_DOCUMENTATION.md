## Data Architecture

All data stored in `localStorage` (prototype). The `SharedStorage` utility provides a unified API:

```
gfitness_members           — All member records
gfitness_bookings          — All booking requests
gfitness_payments          — Payment history
gfitness_attendance        — Check-in records
pending_registrations      — Pending member registrations
admin_events               — Gym events
trainer_accounts           — Trainer login credentials (created by admin)
trainer_availability       — Trainer day toggles (set by trainer)
members_{gymId}            — Per-gym member cache
attendance_{gymId}_{date}  — Per-day attendance log
admin_profile              — Admin profile settings
admin_gym_info             — Gym information settings
admin_membership_plans     — Membership plan configurations
admin_notifications        — Notification preferences
admin_appearance           — Theme/language settings
admin_accounts             — Admin user accounts

## How to Run

npm run dev

## Design Principles

1. **Dark theme only** — flat solid colors, no gradients
2. **Violet + Yellow + Black** palette strictly enforced
3. **Pill-shaped buttons** (rounded-full, 40px height)
4. **Compact layouts** — no dead space, fit content in one screen where possible
5. **Internal scrolling** — panels scroll within themselves, page stays fixed
6. **Mobile frame** — Member app uses 375×812px phone frame (MobileFrame component)
7. **CSS Variables** — all colors use `var(--color-*)` for consistency
8. **RBAC** — role selection happens before login, not after
